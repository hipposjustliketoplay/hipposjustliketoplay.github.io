			<h1>Privacy Policy for Offline Crosswords</h1>
			<p><strong>Last Updated: Nov 07, 2025</strong></p>

			<p>Welcome to Offline Crosswords (the "App"), developed by Paolo Marrone ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your information is handled. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of information through the App, which is available on the Google Play Store. By using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

			<h2>1. About the App</h2>
			<p>The App is a crosswords game. It does not require user login, registration, or collection of personal data. The App is designed for users aged <strong>16 years and older</strong>. Users under this age are not permitted to use the App. If we discover that we have unknowingly collected information from a user under 16, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

			<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
			<p><strong>The App itself does not collect or store any personal data.</strong> However, it uses third-party services to monetize through advertisements. These services may collect certain data automatically for their functionality and analytics.</p>

			<h3>2.1 Advertising (AdMob by Google)</h3>
			<p>We use Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and share certain data such as your device information (e.g., device model, OS version, advertising identifiers), usage data, and location data (if available). This data may be used to personalize ads and for analytics purposes.</p>

			<p>Data collected by AdMob is governed by Google's Privacy Policy: 
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>2.2 Consent and User Controls</h3>
			<p>We have implemented Google's <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to manage consent regarding personalized advertising and data collection. When you launch the App for the first time (or when consent is reset), you will be prompted to accept or customize your ad preferences in accordance with applicable privacy regulations such as GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive.</p>

			<p>You can update or withdraw your consent at any time by accessing the privacy settings within the App. This resets your AdMob ad preferences and brings up the UMP consent dialog again.</p>

			<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
			<p>We do not share any user data directly. However, Google and its partners may process data collected via AdMob as per their own terms and policies. We do not control how Google or its partners use this data beyond what is described in Google's policies.</p>

			<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
			<p>The App does not store personal data. Any data collected through AdMob is retained in accordance with Google’s own data retention policies.</p>

			<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
			<p>This App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under 16. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can remove the information.</p>

			<h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
			<p>The App uses services (like AdMob) that may process your data on servers located outside your country of residence, including in the United States or other jurisdictions. These services are responsible for ensuring appropriate safeguards for such transfers in compliance with data protection laws like the GDPR.</p>

			<h2>7. User Rights</h2>
			<p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data under laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access the data collected about you</li>
				<li>Request correction or deletion of your data</li>
				<li>Object to or restrict certain types of processing</li>
				<li>Withdraw consent where consent has been given</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To exercise these rights regarding data collected by AdMob, you must contact Google directly (<a href="https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff" target="_blank">https://myadcenter.google.com/personalizationoff</a>) or manage your settings via the UMP interface in the App. In the App's privacy page you can reset Ads options. You can also manage your ad preferences on your device by adjusting settings in your Android device’s Google Settings (e.g., resetting your advertising ID).</p>

			<h2>8. Security</h2>
			<p>While no system can be completely secure, we do not collect or store personal data ourselves. Third-party services used by the App (e.g., AdMob) are expected to implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect the data they process.</p>

			<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>

			<h2>10. Contact</h2>
			<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, or if you believe the App is not complying with this policy, you can contact us at:</p>
